# Project-MATVJII

### Context of the project:

You will implement a UI, based on the template that you can find on the virtual
campus with the next funcionalities:
• The cube that appears on the left has to respond to the user inputs following
the presented method of the Holroyd’s arcball and rotate the
cube.
• 5 panels have to be shown on the right. Those panels will contain information
of the equivalent attitude representation parametrized as:
– Quaternions
– Euler principal Angle and Axis
– Euler angles
– Rotation vector
– Rotation matrix
The information must be updated on run time while dragging the cube.
• Every panel except for the rotation matrix has to be editable and must
contain a push button. The push button must update the information in
the other parametrizations accordingly and rotate the figure to represent
the attitude entered by the user.
• A general reset push button has to be implemented. When pressed,
the cube must transform to its original position and all the attitude
parametrization must take the corresponding value of zero rotation as
well.
In addition, proper paper documentation of the implemented code has to be
delivered including at least:
• A list containing the description of all the implemented functions, containing
information of the function purpose, inputs and outputs.
• A diagram relating every possible user action with the functions invoked
and order of execution.
Finally a video-presentation has to be delivered where you explain the past
two points and show the functionalities and the correct operation of the implemented
tool.
